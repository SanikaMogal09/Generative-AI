# LangChain Models 

This repository is created **for learning and practice purposes** while exploring **LangChain models**.  
It contains simple Python scripts to understand how **open-source** and **closed-source** models work with LangChain.

The focus of this repo is **hands-on learning**, not production-ready code.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Learn how LangChain integrates different types of models
- Understand the difference between open-source and closed-source models
- Practice using LLMs, chat models, and embedding models
- Build a strong foundation for future GenAI and RAG projects

---

## 🧠 What I’m Learning Here

- LangChain model abstractions
- Open-source models using Hugging Face
- Closed-source models using APIs
- Text embeddings and vector representations
- Running models locally using Python scripts
